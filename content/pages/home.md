Welcome! I am so glad you are here and are taking the steps to find peace and freedom for yourself or your loved one. My name is Lauren and guiding others to live their lives to the fullest is my goal! Most women and teen girls who come to me wish to be FREE of nagging thoughts, negative self-talk and poor body image. If you find yourself or your child turning to disordered patterns of eating to cope, you are not alone.

As a Licensed Professional Counselor and board-certified Dance/Movement Therapist I have spent years helping girls and women of all ages create lasting change through a powerful blend of psychotherapy and creative arts therapy. Children and teens who may struggle with putting their feelings into words during traditional talk therapy may find using art, movement and music a powerful means to express their thoughts, fears and hopes.

 I currently offer psychotherapy sessions to children, adolescents and women who are struggling with disordered eating patterns, anxiety, depression or low self-esteem in Franklin, TN. I also offer embodiment coaching sessions to women of all ages who have struggled long enough with negative self-image and disordered eating patterns.

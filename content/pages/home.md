**Do you wish you could feel free in your body** but you still can’t release yourself
from years of nagging negative thoughts that keep you feeling low, disconnecting
from others and missing out on what “should be” joyful events with your children
and partner?

Do you have a young teen daughter who seems to be adopting negative body image
or disordered eating patterns and you need expert advice on **how to help her
adopt positive self-image, flexibility and confidence in her growing self?**

Have you tried **traditional talk therapy** only to find that telling the same old
stories about my past and no matter how much to you tried to convince yourself to
love yourself **your body still feels like a stranger?**

Through a powerful blend of psychotherapy, embodiment coaching and movement
therapy you can create more freedom, fullness and body satisfaction without
wasting anymore time in negative thought pattern. This blended approach gets to
the ROOT cause of body dissatisfaction by using the body itself.

(surrender- accepting imperfections, sensations, movement)

    Hi! I’m Lauren Albert.

     For the last several years, I have helped strong but sensitive girls and women like you who are still struggling with intrusive thoughts and negative self-image.  

     I am a board-certified dance/movement therapist and licensed professional counselor who has spent years helping individuals with low self-esteem and disordered eating patterns. I have become passionate about helping women shed light on what’s REALLY going on at the deepest level of their self by using their own greatest tool, **the Body itself**.

     I completed my master’s level training at Drexel University in which I was the first Dance/Movement Therapy intern to work with adolescents and young children struggling with eating disorders, feeding disorders and psychiatric illness in the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. I then spent several years working with at-risk youth in residential settings who were coping with family issues, trauma, eating disorders, developmental delays and psychiatric illnesses while earning my credentials to become a Licensed Professional Counselor. Most recently I worked with women of all ages at the Renfrew Center, the premier center for eating disorder treatment in this country.

     My unique family-centered approach using movement and play create a low-pressure environment that encourages family bonding, laughter and teaches family members to help the identified patient work through disordered eating patterns with-out having a ***power struggle***. In family sessions dance and movement is used as a metaphor to explore relationship issues that are occurring in the home in a way that feels ***safe*** for the child to explore. Most talk therapist are never trained on how to encourage expression in children; creative arts therapy is natural way to encourage expression in children and adolescent who find it difficult to ***simply say how they feel.***

     As a mother of two daughters myself, its paramount that I model self-love and body acceptance in a world in which they will be bombarded with unrealistic images of beauty standards and pressures on social media. Research shows that eating disorders in females has been increasing and the average onset has become younger than ever before. The #1 thing you can do to safeguard your own girls from years of disorder eating and mental illness is to model this confidence within yourself. If you desire to make this change for your children then change can start **NOW. It is my mission to co-create a better world for our daughters and our daughter’s daughters and that change beings NOW and it begins within YOU.**

     You are tired of trying different kinds of therapy that don’t create lasting change and you want to clear years of dieting, negative self-image and trauma from your body.

     You’re ready to finally **accept your body, release shame and feel amazing in your own skin** in order to open yourself up to living life fully, deeply and consciously.

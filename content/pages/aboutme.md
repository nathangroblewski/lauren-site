    Hi! I’m Lauren Albert.

     For the last several years, I have helped strong resilient women like you who are
     still struggling with health, wellness and body satisfaction.

     I am a board-certified dance/movement therapist and licensed professional
     counselor who has spent years helping young girls and women with eating
     disorders. I have become passionate about helping women shed light on what’s
     REALLY going on at the deepest level of their body dissatisfaction and disordered
     eating patterns by using their own greatest tool, **the Body itself**.

     As a mother of two daughters myself, its paramount that I model self-love and body
     acceptance in a world in which they will be bombarded with unrealistic images of
     beauty standards and pressures on social media. Research shows that eating
     disorders in females has been increasing and the average onset has become younger
     than ever before. The #1 thing you can do to safeguard your own girls from years of
     disorder eating and mental illness is to model this confidence within yourself. If you
     desire to make this change for your children then change can start **NOW. It is my
     mission to co-create a better world for our daughters and our daughter’s
     daughters and that change beings NOW and it begins within YOU.**

     You are tired of trying different kinds of therapy that don’t create lasting change and
     you want to clear years of dieting, negative self-image and trauma from your body.
     You’re ready to finally **accept your body, release shame and feel amazing in
     your own skin** in order to open yourself up to living life fully, deeply and
     consciously.

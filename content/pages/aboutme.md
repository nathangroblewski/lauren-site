    Hi! I’m Lauren Albert.

     I am a board-certified dance/movement therapist and licensed professional counselor who has spent years helping individuals with low self-esteem and disordered eating patterns. I have become passionate about helping women shed light on what’s REALLY going on at the deepest level of their self by using their own greatest tool, **the Body itself.**  

     I completed my master’s level training at Drexel University and worked with adolescents and young children struggling with eating disorders, feeding disorders and psychiatric illnesses in the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. I then spent several years working with at-risk youth in residential settings who were coping with family issues, trauma, and developmental delays. Most recently I worked with women of all ages at the Renfrew Center, the premier center for eating disorder treatment in this country.

     My unique family-centered approach using movement and play create a low-pressure environment that encourages family bonding, laughter and teaches family members to work through negative patterns without having a **power struggle.** In family sessions, in addition to traditional therapeutic approaches, movement, music and art can be used as a metaphor to explore relationship issues that are occurring in the home in a way that feels **safe** to explore.
